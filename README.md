# Crypto Trading Bot

This repository contains a simplified example of a cryptocurrency trading bot.
The bot demonstrates how to fetch market data, select trading pairs, execute
basic strategies, and expose a minimal web dashboard for monitoring.

**Disclaimer**: This project is for educational purposes only. Use it at your
own risk. Trading cryptocurrencies carries significant financial risk. The

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the bot:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000`.

The bot code is intentionally simplified and should be extended with proper
error handling, persistent storage, and comprehensive testing before being
used with real funds.
